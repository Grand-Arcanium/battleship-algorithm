 *      A simple Battleship bot, employing a simple Seek and Destroy algorithm with which it

 * </p>
 * <p>
 *      Also implements multiple data structures, such as a hashset to keep track previously selected
 *      targets (and mark them as invalid) and stacks to implement a logical order to some operations.
 * </p>

 *      Future developments of a heatmap based algorithm and smarter and more tuned search
